# Java-Algorithms
Java Algorithms Learning Repository
This repository contains a collection of Java algorithms and data structures, designed to help beginners and intermediate Java programmers improve their coding skills.

Content
The repository contains a range of algorithms and data structures, including:

Sorting algorithms (e.g. Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
Searching algorithms (e.g. Linear Search, Binary Search)
Graph algorithms (e.g. Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
Dynamic Programming algorithms (e.g. Fibonacci Series, Longest Common Subsequence)
Basic data structures (e.g. Stack, Queue, Linked List)
All algorithms and data structures come with clear and well-commented code, making it easy to understand how they work and how to implement them in your own projects.

Getting Started
To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine, and open the relevant .java file for the algorithm or data structure you want to learn about. All the code is well-commented, and you can run the code using a Java Development Kit (JDK) and a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have a new algorithm or data structure you would like to add to the repository, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Support
If you have any questions or need help getting started, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. You can reach me through the repository's issue tracker, or by email at Benjaminkakaimasai@gmail.com.
